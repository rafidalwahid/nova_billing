- Create resource-specific metrics
- Use caching for performance
- Set appropriate refresh intervals

### 5. API Integration
- Create service classes for external APIs
- Use Laravel's HTTP client for API communication
- Implement error handling and retry logic
- Create Nova actions that wrap API functionality

### 6. Performance Optimization
